            <p> This project was my final project for my Data Programming class, which was in Python. The goal was to find a problem and find a dataset related to that problem to analyze and answer questions regarding this problem. The problem I decided to look at was to analyze certain phenomenon in the NBA, such as is the notion of a hot/cold streak a statistically quantifiable idea, also how the toll of an 82 game season can affect team performance.
            </p>
            <p>So I first set out to obtain the dataset using a crawler, which was written in Python, but much more primitive compared to the one I created in my Everything Sports application. However, I do see it as a good learning experience, because up to that point I had no idea how to crawl a webpage. I think another challenge at that point was that I didn’t know HTML so didn’t understand the hierarchy of pages and instead just had to do it blindly. The result was that the data that it obtained was highly unnormalized, so I had to find an alternative data source.</p>
            <p>I ended up finding a publicly available dataset of various NBA statistics, including play by play and individual player statistics. I had to first take the data and format it, so I had to learn how to traverse file directories. Once I got to the data files, I read from it and placed that data into a dictionary, one for play-by-play, and another for player statistics.</p>
            <p>Once the data was formatted, I used it in various ways, such as analyzing shot locations, and creates a scatterplot as well as a heat map of those shot locations for each season. Not only this, but I also examined the notion of a cold/hot streak, to see if it was a true phenomenon with data to back it. Finally I also looked at team’s turnover rate before and after the halfway point in the season (all-star break). </p>
            <p>Although the methodology may not have been perfect, it was a good learning experience on how to handle and analyze large amount of data. I learned a lot of different things, including using matplotlib, pylab, and numpy to analyze large amount of information.
